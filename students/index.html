<p>My main affiliation is the Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM). Students supervised by ISM researchers are not affiliated directly to ISM, instead they are affiliated to SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies). Therefore, if you want to be supervised by an ISM researcher you must pass the entrance examination for the Department of Statistical Science at SOKENDAI. However, after passing the examinations, research is actually conducted at the ISM facilities in Tachikawa, Tokyo. Here are some points to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SOKENDAI does not offer bachelor nor master&rsquo;s degrees, only 3-year and 5-year PhD degree programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you would like to be supervised by me, it would be helpful to have a good grasp of linear algebra and be comfortable with the basics of real analysis.
In addition, some programming skills might be nice too, but the extent to which it is necessary depends on the topic. The most important, however, is to be enthusiastic about optimization and be willing to learn the necessary tools to do your research.</p>
