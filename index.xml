Abstract We introduce the notion of Karamata regular operators, which is a notion of regularity that is suitable for obtaining concrete convergence rates for common fixed point problems. This provides a broad framework that includes, but goes beyond, Hölderian error bounds and Hölder regular operators. By concrete, we mean that the rates we obtain are explicitly expressed in terms of a function of the iteration number \({k}\) instead, of say, a function of the iterate \({x^k}\).</description>

Abstract We discuss the problem of projecting a point onto an arbitrary hyperbolicity cone from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. While hyperbolicity cones are furnished with a generalization of the notion of eigenvalues, obtaining closed form expressions for the projection operator as in the case of semidefinite matrices is an elusive endeavour. To address that we propose a Frank-Wolfe method to handle this task and, more generally, strongly convex optimization over closed convex cones.</description>

Abstract The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>

Abstract In this paper, without requiring any constraint qualifications, we establish tight error bounds for the log-determinant cone, which is the closure of the hypograph of the perspective function of the log-determinant function. This error bound is obtained using the recently developed framework based on one-step facial residual functions.</description>

Abstract In this paper, we consider copositive cones over symmetric cones and show that they are never facially exposed when the underlying cone has dimension at least 2. We do so by explicitly exhibiting a non-exposed extreme ray. Our result extends the known fact that the cone of copositive matrices over the nonnegative orthant is not facially exposed in general.</description>

Abstract In this paper we analyze and solve eigenvalue programs, which consist of the task of minimizing a function subject to constraints on the &amp;ldquo;eigenvalues&amp;rdquo; of the decision variable. Here, by making use of the FTvN systems framework introduced by Gowda, we interpret &amp;ldquo;eigenvalues&amp;rdquo; in a broad fashion going beyond the usual eigenvalues of matrices. This allows us to shed new light on classical problems such as inverse eigenvalues problems and also leads to new applications.</description>

Abstract Let \(({\bf P},{\bf D})\) be a primal-dual pair of SDPs with a nonzero finite duality gap. Under such circumstances, \({\bf P}\) and \({\bf D}\) are weakly feasible and if we perturb the problem data to recover strong feasibility, the (common) optimal value function \(v\) as a function of the perturbation is not well-defined at zero (unperturbed data) since there are &amp;ldquo;two different optimal values&amp;rdquo; \(v({\bf P})\) and \(v({\bf D})\), where \(v({\bf P})\) and \(v({\bf D})\) are the optimal values of \({\bf P}\) and \({\bf D}\) respectively.</description>

Abstract Error bounds are a requisite for trusting or distrusting solutions in an informed way. Until recently, provable error bounds in the absence of constraint qualifications were unattainable for many classes of cones that do not admit projections with known succinct expressions. We build such error bounds for the generalized power cones, using the recently developed framework of one-step facial residual functions.</description>

Abstract We analyze self-dual polyhedral cones and prove several properties about their slack matrices. In particular, we show that self-duality is equivalent to the existence of a positive semidefinite (PSD) slack. Beyond that, we show that if the underlying cone is irreducible, then the corresponding PSD slacks are not only doubly nonnegative matrices (DNN) but are extreme rays of the DNN matrices, which correspond to a family of extreme rays not previously described.</description>

Abstract A hyperbolicity cone is said to be rank-one generated (ROG) if all its extreme rays have rank one, where the rank is computed with respect the underlying hyperbolic polynomial. This is a natural class of hyperbolicity cones which are strictly more general than the ROG spectrahedral cones. In this work, we present a study of the automorphisms of ROG hyperbolicity cones and their derivative relaxations.</description>

Abstract We prove tight Hölderian error bounds for all p-cones. Surprisingly, the exponents differ in several ways from those that have been previously conjectured; moreover, they illuminate p-cones as a curious example of a class of objects that possess properties in 3 dimensions that they do not in 4 or more.</description>

Abstract Amenability is a notion of facial exposedness for convex cones that is stronger than being facially dual complete (or &amp;lsquo;nice&amp;rsquo;) which is, in turn, stronger than merely being facially exposed. Hyperbolicity cones are a family of algebraically structured closed convex cones that contain all spectrahedra (linear sections of positive semidefinite cones) as special cases. It is known that all spectrahedra are amenable.</description>

Abstract Amenability is a geometric property of convex cones that is stronger than facial exposedness and assists in the study of error bounds for conic feasibility problems. In this paper we establish numerous properties of amenable cones, and investigate the relationships between amenability and other properties of convex cones, such as niceness and projectional exposure.</description>

Abstract We construct a general framework for deriving error bounds for conic feasibility problems. In particular, our approach allows one to work with cones that fail to be amenable or even to have computable projections, two previously challenging barriers. For the purpose, we first show how error bounds may be constructed using objects called facial residual functions.</description>

Abstract We introduce the notion of consistent error bound functions which provides a unifying framework for error bounds for multiple convex sets. This framework goes beyond the classical Lipschitzian and Hölderian error bounds and includes, for example, the error bounds obtainable under the theory of amenable cones. One of the main results we prove is that the convergence rate of several algorithms for feasibility problems can be expressed explicitly in terms of the underlying consistent error bound function.</description>

Abstract In semidefinite programming the dual may fail to attain its optimal value and there could be a duality gap, i.e., the primal and dual optimal values may differ. In a striking paper, Ramana proposed a polynomial size extended dual that does not have these deficiencies and yields a number of fundamental results in complexity theory. The known expositions of Ramana&amp;rsquo;s dual tend to be somewhat technical; here we give a concise and self-contained derivation, relying mostly on elementary linear algebra.</description>

Abstract The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma states that there exist linear maps that project a set of points of a vector space into a space of much lower dimension such that the Euclidean distance between these points is approximately preserved. This lemma has been previously used to prove that we can randomly aggregate, using a random matrix whose entries are drawn from a zero-mean sub-Gaussian distribution, the equality constraints of an Linear Program (LP) while preserving approximately the value of the problem.</description>

      <description>My main affiliation is the Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM). Students supervised by ISM researchers are not affiliated directly to ISM, instead they are affiliated to SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies). Therefore, if you want to be supervised by an ISM researcher you must pass the entrance examination for the Department of Statistical Science at SOKENDAI. However, after passing the examinations, research is actually conducted at the ISM facilities in Tachikawa, Tokyo.</description>
