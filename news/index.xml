Abstract Let \(({\bf P},{\bf D})\) be a primal-dual pair of SDPs with a nonzero finite duality gap. Under such circumstances, \({\bf P}\) and \({\bf D}\) are weakly feasible and if we perturb the problem data to recover strong feasibility, the (common) optimal value function \(v\) as a function of the perturbation is not well-defined at zero (unperturbed data) since there are &amp;ldquo;two different optimal values&amp;rdquo; \(v({\bf P})\) and \(v({\bf D})\), where \(v({\bf P})\) and \(v({\bf D})\) are the optimal values of \({\bf P}\) and \({\bf D}\) respectively.</description>

Abstract Error bounds are a requisite for trusting or distrusting solutions in an informed way. Until recently, provable error bounds in the absence of constraint qualifications were unattainable for many classes of cones that do not admit projections with known succinct expressions. We build such error bounds for the generalized power cones, using the recently developed framework of one-step facial residual functions.</description>

Abstract We analyze self-dual polyhedral cones and prove several properties about their slack matrices. In particular, we show that self-duality is equivalent to the existence of a positive semidefinite (PSD) slack. Beyond that, we show that if the underlying cone is irreducible, then the corresponding PSD slacks are not only doubly nonnegative matrices (DNN) but are extreme rays of the DNN matrices, which correspond to a family of extreme rays not previously described.</description>

Abstract A hyperbolicity cone is said to be rank-one generated (ROG) if all its extreme rays have rank one, where the rank is computed with respect the underlying hyperbolic polynomial. This is a natural class of hyperbolicity cones which are strictly more general than the ROG spectrahedral cones. In this work, we present a study of the automorphisms of ROG hyperbolicity cones and their derivative relaxations.</description>

Abstract We prove tight Hölderian error bounds for all p-cones. Surprisingly, the exponents differ in several ways from those that have been previously conjectured; moreover, they illuminate p-cones as a curious example of a class of objects that possess properties in 3 dimensions that they do not in 4 or more.</description>

Abstract Amenability is a notion of facial exposedness for convex cones that is stronger than being facially dual complete (or &amp;lsquo;nice&amp;rsquo;) which is, in turn, stronger than merely being facially exposed. Hyperbolicity cones are a family of algebraically structured closed convex cones that contain all spectrahedra (linear sections of positive semidefinite cones) as special cases. It is known that all spectrahedra are amenable.</description>

Abstract Amenability is a geometric property of convex cones that is stronger than facial exposedness and assists in the study of error bounds for conic feasibility problems. In this paper we establish numerous properties of amenable cones, and investigate the relationships between amenability and other properties of convex cones, such as niceness and projectional exposure.</description>

Abstract We construct a general framework for deriving error bounds for conic feasibility problems. In particular, our approach allows one to work with cones that fail to be amenable or even to have computable projections, two previously challenging barriers. For the purpose, we first show how error bounds may be constructed using objects called facial residual functions.</description>

Abstract We introduce the notion of consistent error bound functions which provides a unifying framework for error bounds for multiple convex sets. This framework goes beyond the classical Lipschitzian and Hölderian error bounds and includes, for example, the error bounds obtainable under the theory of amenable cones. One of the main results we prove is that the convergence rate of several algorithms for feasibility problems can be expressed explicitly in terms of the underlying consistent error bound function.</description>

Abstract In semidefinite programming the dual may fail to attain its optimal value and there could be a duality gap, i.e., the primal and dual optimal values may differ. In a striking paper, Ramana proposed a polynomial size extended dual that does not have these deficiencies and yields a number of fundamental results in complexity theory. The known expositions of Ramana&amp;rsquo;s dual tend to be somewhat technical; here we give a concise and self-contained derivation, relying mostly on elementary linear algebra.</description>

Abstract The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma states that there exist linear maps that project a set of points of a vector space into a space of much lower dimension such that the Euclidean distance between these points is approximately preserved. This lemma has been previously used to prove that we can randomly aggregate, using a random matrix whose entries are drawn from a zero-mean sub-Gaussian distribution, the equality constraints of an Linear Program (LP) while preserving approximately the value of the problem.</description>
