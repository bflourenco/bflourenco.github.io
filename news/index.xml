Abstract We introduce the notion of consistent error bound functions which provides a unifying framework for error bounds for multiple convex sets. This framework goes beyond the classical Lipschitzian and Hölderian error bounds and includes, for example, the error bounds obtainable under the theory of amenable cones. One of the main results we prove is that the convergence rate of several algorithms for feasibility problems can be expressed explicitly in terms of the underlying consistent error bound function.</description>

Abstract In semidefinite programming the dual may fail to attain its optimal value and there could be a duality gap, i.e., the primal and dual optimal values may differ. In a striking paper, Ramana proposed a polynomial size extended dual that does not have these deficiencies and yields a number of fundamental results in complexity theory. The known expositions of Ramana&amp;rsquo;s dual tend to be somewhat technical; here we give a concise and self-contained derivation, relying mostly on elementary linear algebra.</description>

Abstract The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma states that there exist linear maps that project a set of points of a vector space into a space of much lower dimension such that the Euclidean distance between these points is approximately preserved. This lemma has been previously used to prove that we can randomly aggregate, using a random matrix whose entries are drawn from a zero-mean sub-Gaussian distribution, the equality constraints of an Linear Program (LP) while preserving approximately the value of the problem.</description>
